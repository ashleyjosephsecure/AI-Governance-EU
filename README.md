# EU AI Act Governance & Implementation Framework
**Strategic Risk Management and Regulatory Alignment for High-Stakes AI Environments.**

---

## 📌 Project Mission
To provide a structured, auditable framework for organizations to align their Artificial Intelligence deployments with the **EU AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)**. This repository bridges the gap between technical AI development and legal accountability, focusing on **Clinical, Pharmaceutical, and Financial infrastructure.**



## ⚖️ Regulatory Hierarchy (Risk-Based Approach)
This framework utilizes the EU's four-tier risk classification to determine governance requirements:

1. **Unacceptable Risk:** (e.g., Social Scoring) -> **Action:** Immediate Decommissioning.
2. **High-Risk:** (e.g., Medical Diagnostics, HR Recruitment) -> **Action:** Strict Conformity Assessments & Logging.
3. **Limited Risk:** (e.g., Chatbots) -> **Action:** Mandatory Transparency Disclosures.
4. **Minimal Risk:** (e.g., Spam filters) -> **Action:** Voluntary Codes of Conduct.

## 🛠️ Repository Structure
This repository is organized into the following functional pillars:

* **/legal-frameworks:** Summaries and cross-mappings between the EU AI Act and NIST AI RMF.
* **/inventory:** A standardized registry for tracking and classifying AI assets.
* **/incident-logs:** Formal documentation of AI-related security breaches and mitigation steps.
* **/policies:** Corporate-ready documents (Bias Prevention, Human Oversight, Data Integrity).
* **/templates:** Ready-to-use Vendor Assessments and Conformity Questionnaires.
