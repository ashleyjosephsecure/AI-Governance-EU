# EU AI Act: Governance & Strategic Risk Framework
**Navigating the Regulatory Landscape of Autonomous Systems (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689).**

## 🎯 Strategic Objective
To provide Fortune 500 organizations and Clinical/Pharmaceutical entities with a structured methodology for achieving compliance with the **EU AI Act**. This framework bridges the gap between technical AI development and legal accountability, ensuring that innovation does not bypass ethical and regulatory guardrails.

## ⚖️ The Risk-Based Classification
Under the EU AI Act, systems are governed based on the severity of their impact. This framework provides the controls necessary for each tier:

### 🔴 Unacceptable Risk (Prohibited)
* **Scope:** Systems that manipulate human behavior, perform indiscriminate social scoring, or utilize public biometric identification.
* **Counsel Action:** Full decommissioning of systems or pivot to compliant alternatives.

### 🟡 High-Risk (Regulated)
* **Scope:** AI in critical infrastructure, medical device diagnostics, HR recruitment, and credit scoring.
* **Governance Requirement:** Mandatory **Fundamental Rights Impact Assessments (FRIA)** and continuous post-market monitoring.

### 🔵 Limited Risk (Transparency)
* **Scope:** Chatbots, deepfakes, and generative content.
* **Governance Requirement:** Explicit disclosure to users that they are interacting with an automated agent.
