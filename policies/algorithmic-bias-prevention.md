# AI Fairness Policy: [Company Name]
**Standard:** EU AI Act Article 10 (Data & Data Governance)

## 1. Data Quality Standards
Training datasets for "High Risk" AI must be:
- **Relevant:** Data must match the actual clinical/operational environment.
- **Representative:** Must include diverse demographics to prevent bias.
- **Error-Free:** Data must be scrubbed of historical prejudices before training.

## 2. The Kill Switch (Human Oversight)
Every "High Risk" decision (e.g., hiring or medical diagnosis) must have a **Human-in-the-loop (HITL)**. No AI is authorized to make a final life-altering decision without a human signature.
